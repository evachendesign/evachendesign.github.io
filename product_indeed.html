						<h3>Business issue & project goal</h3>
						<p>Only 20% of users have fully completed their profiles. Our goal is to inspire users to complete their profiles for more accurate job matching.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>User problem identified from UX research</h3>
						<p>1. A lack of guidance leaves users unsure of how to update their profiles.</p>
						<p>2. The profile page's placement deep within the interface dissuades users from updating their profiles.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>To tackle these obstacles, I've introduced a new user flow that complements the original one, facilitating easier access for profile updates. This revamped system provides targeted guidance to users, advising them to update their profiles based on our big data analytics. Moreover, the inclusion of a strength indicator provides users with an evaluation of their profile's robustness, spurring them to make improvements.</p>

					<h3>Understanding job seekers' perspectives on completing and updating their profiles</h3>
					<div>
						<h5>Methodology:</h5>
						<p>My investigation into job seekers' attitudes toward profile updates involved three methods:</p>
						<ul class="points">
							<li><span class="highlight">Literature review:</span> Rolled up 46 articles from the Indeed Research Library, examining and integrating findings from pre-existing research in our problem area.</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">Usability testing:</span> Observation of user behavior during their job-seeking process.</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">Contextual inquiry:</span> Interviewed with 10 job seekers from various professional backgrounds.</li>

				<div class="secondspacer">
					<h3>Finding 1: Job seekers acknowledge the value of profile updates</h3>
					<div>
						<h5>Literature review findings:</h5>
						<ul class="points">
							<li>Job seekers perceive Indeed Profiles as an opportunity to present a comprehensive and personalized view of their professional selves, enabling them to better appeal to potential employers.</li>
							<li>There's an intrinsic motivation among job seekers to provide detailed information, mainly if it aids in connecting them with better job opportunities - a benefit that also extends to employers.</li>
						</ul>

				</div>
				<div class="secondspacer">
					<h3>Finding 2: Lack of guidance discourages users from updating their profiles</h3>
					<div>
						<h5>Literature review findings:</h5>
						<ul class="points">
							<li>The main factors preventing job seekers from providing information are Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), fear of being stereotyped, and potential bias from employers.</li>
							<li>Job seekers are okay with cues or prompts to provide information. However, without proper guidance, their motivation to follow through is lacking.</li>

					<h3>Finding 3: The deep placement of the profile page deters users from updates</h3>
					<div>
						<h5>Usability Testing Findings:</h5>
						<p>Job seekers mainly interact with the homepage to search for jobs. The deeply buried profile page is often overlooked during their job search Navigating to the profile page requires 3 clicks, a portal 40% of users think hard to find.</p>

					<h3>Summary: pain points</h3>
					<p>I identified two main barriers that discourage users from updating their profiles:</p>
					<ol class="numberlist">
						<li><span class="colorhighlight">The lack of guidance</span> forces users to rely on external resources, slowing the profile updating process.</li>
						<li>The deep placement of the profile page <span class="colorhighlight">prevents users from realizing the need for profile updates</span> during their job search.</li>

					<h3>Guiding and notifying users</h3>
					<p>In light of the findings from the user experience research, the core direction for the design improvements centers on eliminating the barriers that users face when updating their profiles. The two key strategies to achieve this are:</p>
					<ol class="numberlist">
						<li><span class="colorhighlight">Offering guidance:</span> Assisting users during the profile update process.</li>
						<li><span class="colorhighlight">Providing notifications:</span> Alerting users about the necessity of profile updates.</li>

						<h3>Investigating guidance strategies in the market</h3>
						<p>To better understand the existing strategies for profile update guidance in the market, I conducted an analysis of 10 competitors:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="twoevencolumn">
							<div class="thirdspacer">
								<h5>4 direct competitors</h5>

							</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="secondspacer">
					<div>
						<h3>Finding: Actionable and personalized guidance lacking in current market</h3>
						<p>The analysis identified an evident market gap: a notable lack of actionable and personalized advice for updating profiles.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="centerimg">
						<img class="centerimg" src="images/product_indeed/6_analysis.png" alt="market gap"/>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3>Key takeaways for design direction</h3>
					<p>Based on the findings from the competitive analysis, our guidance system should incorporate two main principles:</p>
					<ol class="numberlist">
						<li><span class="colorhighlight">Actionability:</span> The guidance should be actionable, offering clear steps that users can follow.</li>
						<li><span class="colorhighlight">Personalization:</span> The guidance should be specifically tailored to the needs, experiences, and objectives of each user.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Addressing pain point 1: absence of guidance for profile updates</h3>
					<p>I explored several guidance options to aid users in updating their profiles. The most effective solution, as deemed by usability and understandability, was a number and level strength indicator.</p>
					<img class="fullwidthimg" src="images/product_indeed/7_ideation1.png" alt="Number and Level Strength Indicator was chosen over all other explored alternatives."/>

					<h3>Addressing pain point 2: hidden profile page</h3>
					<p>Despite constraints in adjusting the app's structure, various methods were proposed to prompt users to update their profiles. Notifications emerged as the most effective strategy, with internal data revealing a 40% user engagement rate.</p>

					<h3>Mid-fidelity prototypes and design choices</h3>

				<div class="twoevencolumn">
					<div>
						<h5>Concept A</h5>
						<br>
						<p>Concept A is a design solution aimed at aiding users in grasping the qualifications necessary for their target jobs. It offers a lucid depiction of profile strength levels (e.g., Basic, Good, Great) and a numerical comparison of a user's current qualifications against the recommended ones based on our extensive data analysis. This design was chosen for its:</p>
						<br>
						<ul class="points">
							<li>Simplicity in both visual and conceptual representation.</li>
							<li>Motivational drive, fueled by the contrast between current and recommended qualifications.</li>
							<li>Compatibility with Indeed's brand aesthetics.</li>

					<div>
						<h5>Concept B</h5>
						<br>
						<p>Concept B revamps the profile updating process into an engaging, game-like experience where users accumulate key fragments. The completion of profile updates rewards users with a fully formed key. This design was chosen for its:</p>
						<br>
						<ul class="points">
							<li>Innovative approach towards user motivation and behavior alteration.</li>
							<li>While posing a riskier strategy, its potential impact is deemed worth exploring. The design targets managers' preferences for engagement, an aspect that needs to be investigated further.</li>

					<h3>Broadening the scope to various occupations</h3>
					<p>The present design, exemplified through a cashier role, needs expansion to cater to the broad spectrum of job roles. Coordinating with data scientists to understand occupation-specific data is essential to integrate diverse guidance categories into the design. For instance, a 'Certification' section, critical for professions like nursing, should be incorporated for comprehensive and efficient career guidance.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Addressing ethical concerns</h3>
					<p>Interestingly, while job seekers showed a general unwillingness to lie on their profiles, they seemed open to the idea of stretching their qualifications to fit recommendations. This unveils a potential ethical risk associated with the solution. To mitigate this, it would be prudent to implement a system where users are required to complete a skills assessment or provide more detailed information about their skills before these can be added to their profiles. This can serve as a control mechanism to ensure a more truthful representation of their capabilities.</p>
