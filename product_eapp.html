				<h2>promote indeed profile updates</h2>
				<p class="large">
					<span class="highlight">Background: </span>
					General Motors operates a comprehensive database to monitor the status of cars owned by their customers. Various sensors installed in the cars provide real-time data on vehicle conditions, covering damage issues caused by fender benders or more serve collisions and maintenance needs like oil levels. Car dealerships utilize this database to offer car owners timely maintenance and repair services, reflecting General Motors' commitment to exceptional customer care.
				</p>
				<p class="large">
					<span class="highlight">Project Overview: </span>
					EAPP, a B2B2C service tool, was developed to facilitate service advisors in accessing vehicle condition data and delivering services to car owners. I undertook the responsibility of redesigning this outdated tool to provide car dealers with an efficient means of accessing the information necessary to deliver high-quality customer service.

						<h3>Business goal</h3>
						<p>The objective was to enhance the car dealer's application, EAPP, to make it more appealing to a broader range of car dealer brands (subsidiaries) within the General Motors family, including Cadillac, Buick, and Chevy.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Design problems (high level)</h3>
						<ol class="numberlist">
							<li>The tool's existing functions and categorization must be adjusted to align with the current user workflow.</li>
							<li>The presentation of information within the tool was difficult to read, thus affecting staff efficiency.</li>
							<li>Staff had to manually sync information with colleagues, which led to inefficiencies.</li>
							<li>The application lacked a design system, making the development and iteration processes less streamlined.</li>

							<p>Many more prominent car dealers allocate their service advisors more specifically. They don't only categorize it as maintenance and repair. They separate repair into collision and minor malfunction because car owners usually need more emergent assistance from specially trained service advisors when there is a collision. Therefore, a new categorization is required in this working mode.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Adapting design to evolving user needs</h3>
					<p>As the product gained popularity, it required numerous changes in its iterations to cater to a larger user group. These changes demanded significant effort and resources from both the engineering team and myself. Reflecting on this experience, I learned several important lessons:</p>
					<ul class="points">
						<li><span class="highlight">Understanding the Long-term Product Plan: </span>I realized the importance of grasping the long-term product plan to improve efficiency and streamline product iteration. Before initiating any design work, it's crucial to collaborate closely with product managers to understand the current and future plans for the product. This should include researching both the needs of current users and the requirements of future target users.</li>
						<li><span class="highlight">Gradual Approach to Design Changes: </span>A step-by-step approach to design changes can help in cost-saving. Making incremental changes based on user feedback and needs allows for more manageable and cost-effective iterations.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Importance of product ecosystem</h3>
					<p>By interacting with other departments and subsidiaries within the group company, I discovered the vital need for information synchronization across different departments. This collaboration is key to improving efficiency and having a more significant impact. Cross-team collaboration allows for a more comprehensive view of the product ecosystem and can lead to more informed and effective design decisions.</p>
